        <h2>Background of the Agency</h2>
        <p>The Terengganu State Museum Board was established under the Enactment of the Terengganu State Museum Board (Enactment No. 9 of 1976) which was approved by the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly on 28 December 1976 and came into effect on 1 November 1977. The main aim of the establishment of this institution is to dignify the state's Cultural Heritage through museum activities namely Collecting, Conserving, Saving, Researching and Disseminating Information.</p>
        <p>Starting at Bukit Che Long, Kuala Terengganu by occupying a corner of the former State Secretary's Office building, the State Museum began to expand its wings to Bukit Losong on a site of 27 hectares (currently 23 hectares). This new location known as the State Museum Complex, Bukit Losong was inaugurated by the late DYMM Sultan Mahmud AlMuktafi Billah Shah, the 15th Sultan of Terengganu on 20 April 1996 corresponding to 2 Zulhijjah 1416.</p>
        <p>The State Museum Complex includes three (3) main components which are the Main Building, the Park Area and the Maritime Museum.

All of these houses are originals that were moved to this park.</p>
        <p>In addition, in this park there is also a hill known as Bukit Herba which is planted with various types of traditional Terengganu Malay herbs. The Maritime Museum at Bukit Losong is the first in the country. This area displays a collection of Terengganu's traditional boats openly, including two (2) Big Boats that symbolize the greatness of the state's community in the boat-making industry and marine science.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, the State Museum also has other premises outside the complex, namely, Dungun District Museum, Kemaman District Museum, Duyong Old Town, Haji Su Heritage House (Losong), Bukit Puteri (Kuala Terengganu), Batu Bersurat Memorial (Hulu Terengganu) and Tengku Anjang Palace (Besut).</p>
