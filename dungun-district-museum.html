            <h3>Dungun District Museum Establishment History</h3>
            <p>The inspiration for the establishment of the District Museum arose from the launch of the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) by YAB Prime Minister of Malaysia on 28 October 2007 which emphasized the promotion of coastal tourism, islands, culture and heritage. The Terengganu State Museum Board proposed to the State Government that Dungun District be set up as a Museum because since the 1930s, it has been known throughout the world related to iron ore mining activities in Bukit Besi, Dungun. The 'soft opening' ceremony of the Dungun District Museum was launched on 19 August 2008.</p>

            <h3>Dungun District Officer's House History</h3>
            <p>The Dungun District Officer's House was built in 1941 and measures 24.5m long and 6.63m wide. The house, which now looks dilapidated, is made of wood and has a cement roof. It was once the temporary residence of the British Assistant Adviser. Dungun District officials who lived here were Tuan Haji Dol Abdullah bin Alias ​​(1941-1942), Che Khalid bin Kassim (1943-1945), Haji Khalid bin Awang (1974-1975) and many others.</p>
