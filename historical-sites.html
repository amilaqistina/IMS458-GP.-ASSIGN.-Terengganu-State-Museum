                    <img src="stone2.jpg" alt="Lettered Stone Memorial">
                </div>
                <p>The Lettered Memorial was developed as a commemoration of the discovery of the Lettered Stone. The lettered stone is a written proof of the declaration of Islam as the official religion for the State of Terengganu and even in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
                <p>Since this place is such an important site in the history of the state and the country, it is appropriate that it be developed and made into a place of study and visit by the residents of this state in particular and tourists in general.</p>
                <p>It is hoped that with the existence of this Memorial more researchers, history enthusiasts and tourists will visit here to see the environment of this important place, in addition to being able to read the information and statements contained on the Inscribed Stone.</p>
                <p>The Lettered Stone Memorial is designed as a square measuring 11400 cm x 11400 cm and has thirteen (13) floors including a replica of the Lettered Stone which symbolizes the Pillars of Faith and the total number of districts in the State of Terengganu. The building material consists of ordinary granite and black granite.</p>
                <p>This memorial was inaugurated by YAB Dato' Seri Amar Di Raja Tan Sri Haji Wan Mokhtar bin Ahmad, Terengganu Chief Minister on 13 April 1992.</p>

                <p>Tengku Anjang Palace or better known as Istana Kampung Raja, Besut is an Old Malay Palace built by the Sultan who ruled the Besut district in Terengganu.</p>
                <p>This palace is located in Kampung Raja, Besut, Terengganu. It faces the old mosque and the Besut river. Its construction concept has been influenced by architecture from Riau and Siam.</p>
                <p>Istana Tengku Anjang depicts an architecture that is considered unique not only from the chronological aspect of its history but also from the design aspect, especially from the aspect of combining multi-lingual architecture.</p>
                <p>It displays the results of different architectural works and is the result of the best architectural heritage in the Southeast Asian region.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Haji Su Heritage House has an architecture characteristic of Malay architecture with a combination of two architectural features, namely Rumah Bujang Berpeleh and Rumah Limas Delanda or Potong Delanda.</p>
                <p>The uniqueness of the architecture and the importance of local history became an attraction for the Terengganu State Museum Board to conserve this mansion. It is also able to attract foreign tourists to come visit Terengganu for those who see for themselves the heritage value found in the architecture of this old building.</p>
                <p>This Heritage House was built in Kampung Losong Haji Su on three land lots numbered 224, 1491 and lot 1781 with an area of ​​0.8 hectares. The original owner of this house is Su Mohammed Salleh bin Haji Mohamad or better known as Haji Su.</p>
                <p>In 2008, the Terengganu State Museum Board took the initiative to obtain an allocation from the Terengganu State Government to take over this mansion. After getting approval from the Terengganu State Government, in 2010 this building was successfully taken over at a cost of 3.2 million including the cost of land and maintaining together the knowledge of Malay architectural carpentry that symbolizes the essence of technological progress, the height of artistic value and the pattern of cultural patterns.</p>
                <p>The Terengganu State Museum Board has been given the responsibility to carry out conservation works through conservation methods. Preliminary work began in 2012, while conservation work began in 2014 and was officially completed and handed over on 6 April 2016. Haji Su Heritage House opened for visitors on 1 June 2016.</p>

            <h3>4. Bidong Island Development and Conservation</h3>
            <div class="toggle-content" id="site4">
                <div class="photos">
                    <img src="bidong1.jpeg" alt="Bidong Island">
                    <img src="bidong2.jpg" alt="Bidong Island">
                </div>
                <p>Bidong Island was originally just a lonely and uninhabited island. The island has an area of ​​203 hectares separated by the South China Sea and it takes about 30 minutes to travel from the mainland. Most of the island consists of hilly highlands with only 12 hectares of undulating flat land. This topography makes Bidong a focal point for fishermen to take shelter from the monsoon winds.</p>
                <p>However, the harmony of Bidong Island began to be undermined following the fall of the Democratic Government of South Vietnam (KDVS) supported by America to the Communist Government of North Vietnam (KKVU) in 1975. This event led to the existence of a group known as Orang Hanyut Vietnam (OHV) which encroached on the coast of Peninsular Malaysia, especially Terengganu State Darul Iman.</p>
                <p>This uninvited arrival received support from foreign countries, especially America, who suggested that the Malaysian Government give good treatment to OHVs. Based on universal humanitarianism, the Malaysian government has taken appropriate steps by providing a special settlement to facilitate security control and the distribution of aid.</p>
                <p>Following that with the approval of the state government, Pulau Bidong on 1 August 1978 was gazetted as an OHV Settlement Center.</p>
                <p>Since then Bidong began to change its face. The land was greedily dug up on the grounds of building facilities for staff and OHV. Fishermen are not allowed to approach the island from a distance of 200 yards even for shelter. The harmonious and free island of Bidong is now a forbidden island including to the natives themselves.</p>
                <p>For 16 years, the land of Bidong was cultivated and during that time, this land has been beneficial to 252,390 OHVs who have lived here. Bidong began to be carved on the world map and at the same time, the Malaysian Government received praise after praise for its good treatment of OHV. Bidong during the OHV occupation was also known as Mini Saigon due to the population density and the vibrancy of its diverse activities.</p>
                <p>Bidong Island was finally closed and handed back to the Terengganu Government on November 30, 1991. A lot of nostalgia was left behind for future generations to remember and look at. However, as a result of not-so-serious actions and a lot of time spent at the meeting table, most of the remains of history have been destroyed. Regardless, this island is still visited by OHVs or their heirs who come to visit the graves and also as an appreciation to the earth that once gave them protection.</p>
                <p>Parallel to that, it is appropriate that this island be developed with the concept of Histo-Tourism, which is tourism based on historical remains in addition to natural beauty.</p>

            <h3>5. Princess Hill</h3>
            <div class="toggle-content" id="site5">

                    <img src="puteri1.jpg" alt="Princess Hill">
                    <img src="puteri2.jpg" alt="Princess Hill">
                </div>
                <p>Princess Hill is located within the city of Kuala Terengganu and close to the mouth of the Terengganu River. This historic hill has an area of ​​approximately 0.688 hectares with a height of approximately 200 meters above sea level. The location is also very strategic as a tourism asset because it is close to the historic buildings of Istana Maziah and Abidin Mosque. In addition, the main focus of the public which is the Post Office and the Payang Market which is adjacent to it makes the position of the hill even more special.</p>
                <p>There are several stories about the origin of the name Princess Hill. However, it is not certain when this hill got its name. When Dato' Bandahara Padang Saujana Johor (Deceased 1697) sent his representative Megat Seri Rama and Paduka to rule Terengganu, this hill was already known as Princess Hill. However, there is a legendary oral story that is so popular among the people of this state that this hill used to be the residence of an elf princess. Local residents often borrow dishes from the princess for car feasts. However, this princess ends up sulking when the borrowed crockery is not returned or is returned in a damaged state. This princess is said to have run away to Besut and because of that there is a hill in the area which is also known as Princess Hill.</p>
                <p>This legendary hill once became important as a defensive fortress especially during the political upheaval of the Terengganu Sultanate between 1831 to 1839 involving Tengku Umar with Sultan Mansor II and Tengku Umar with Sultan Muhamad I. At that time Princess Hill became a strategic stronghold. The effects of the Civil War remain to this day as a historical legacy. Among them is a fortress, a temporary throne, a place to store guns and cannons.</p>

            <h3>6. Bewah Gua Archaeological Site</h3>

                </div>
                <p>Bewah Cave, a limestone cave located on Mount Bewah in Lake Kenyir, is the second cave after Tuk Bidan Cave that has been submerged due to the construction of the Kenyir Dam. This cave, situated in a lake area of approximately 2590 km² or 260,000 hectares, holds many prehistoric treasures dating back to the Hoabinhian period. Prehistoric humans inhabited this cave around 13,400 years ago, as confirmed by radiocarbon dating in 2010.</p>
                <p>Research conducted by researchers from the National University of Malaysia and the Terengganu State Museum found numerous Hoabinhian stone tools such as grinding stones, pounding stones, inlay stones, pottery fragments, and food remnants.</p>
                <p>Archaeological findings indicate that Bewah Cave was a significant settlement during the Hoabinhian and Neolithic periods. Additionally, the Terengganu Geoscience Department discovered rich fossil deposits on Mount Bewah, including the Alatochonchidea bivalve, unique to Southeast Asia and one of only seven species worldwide. Previously, a species of cave cockroach unique to Bewah Cave was also found, adding to its allure for visitors, especially international tourists.</p>
                <p>The area around Bewah Cave served as a crucial route for ancient migrations between Terengganu, Kelantan, and Pahang via the Sepia or Sat/Tembeling rivers. Historical excavations since 1956 have uncovered various artifacts and human remains, shedding light on the region's ancient history from the Neolithic Stone Age (3000 to 800 BC) onward.</p>
                <p>Excavations by the Department of Museums and Antiquities, in collaboration with the Terengganu State Museum Board and National University of Malaysia, continue to uncover more about Bewah Cave's rich archaeological heritage.</p>

            <h3>7. Duyong Old City</h3>

                </div>
                <p>Duyong Old City is located on Duyong Island, approximately 7 kilometers from the city center. Known as Kota Tok Hakim, it was built by Dato' Biji Sura (Nik Mohamad bin Hitam) in 1919 and completed in 1920. Originally used as a place for religious study and Quranic learning by local residents.</p>
            <p>Duyong Old City holds significant architectural heritage for the State of Terengganu Darul Iman. Its construction method features unique and intricate carving artistry.</p>
            <p>The city is constructed using a blend of materials including honey, lime, egg white, sand, and stone, covering an area of approximately 400 square meters. It comprises 9 roofs interconnected across various sections including the kitchen, bathroom, porch, and bridge. The design resembles a miniature palace of a Malay ruler, enriched with elements of foreign architectural influences like Corinthian or Egyptian styles, especially evident in the columns and stone walls.</p>
            <p>This architectural gem blends traditional Terengganu Malay house types such as Bujang Berpeleh, Limas Bungkus, and Limas Belanda adorned with intricate carvings around the veranda. The craftsmanship reflects contributions from local Malay artisans and Chinese craftsmen from Singapore.</p>
            <p>Recognizing its significance to future generations, the Ministry of Culture and Arts undertook the initiative to restore Duyong Old City, which was abandoned and severely damaged during the 1986 flood. It has been open to the public since 2005.</p>
