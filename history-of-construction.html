        <h2>History of The Museum Construction</h2>
        <p>In the early stages of its establishment, the State Museum stayed in a corner of the former State Secretary's Office (at that time it had become the Central Office) on Bukit Che Long in Jalan Cherong Lanjut, Kuala Terengganu. Recruitment of staff began in 1976 and was administered by an officer from the General Administration Division, Office of the Secretary to the Government as the Secretary of the State Museum Board. The State Museum stood as a separate identity after the appointment of a Curator in September 1981, then known as the Director in 1985.</p>
        <p>Since then, the operation of the museum began to stand out and became more active, especially the collection of collections in addition to research work. The museum has opened two galleries in this old building and is open to the public every day during office hours. Although the physical condition of the building is not suitable, the performance shown by the museum made the State Government realize that this institution needs attention. As a result, in the early 1980s, the State Government Council agreed to provide allocations for the construction of a new Museum Complex on a 27-hectare (60-acre) site in Kampung Bukit Losong, Mukim Paloh, Kuala Terengganu.</p>
        <p>The selection of the location of the Museum Complex is in line with UNESCO's recommendations which outline some specific criteria for museum construction. Among them are :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has a peaceful and comfortable natural garden area. This phenomenon highlights a harmonious atmosphere and is suitable for those who need tranquility.</li>
            <li>Spacious and open area. This situation provides space for various activities related to the museum.</li>
            <li>Sufficient space. A suitable space is very important for a museum. This will facilitate planning to make the museum complete and attractive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>Construction work on the new Museum Complex began in 1985 and was built in five phases. The implementation of Phase 1 began in 1985 which included infrastructure works such as the preparation of main access roads and drains, bridge construction, provision of parking facilities as well as land preparation and repair works to stabilize the hillsides.</p>
        <h3>Phase II</h3>
        <p>Phase II was implemented in 1986 covering garden art works such as the planting of basic and decorative trees as well as the construction of 'retaining wall', 'retaining boulder' and footpaths. The work of moving and relocating four traditional houses namely Istana Tengku Long, Rumah Tele, Rumah Bujang Berpeleh and Rumah Hajjah Ngah Aishah was also carried out.</p>
        <h3>Phase III</h3>
        <p>Phase III which covers the construction of the Maritime Museum I (Sailway and Trade Gallery) was carried out in 1988 including the relocation of two large boats namely Sabar and Kemajuan.</p>
        <h3>Phase IV</h3>
        <p>The construction work of the main building was carried out through Phase IV in 1989 and the groundbreaking ceremony in 1991 was completed by YAB Dato' Setia Wangsa, Dato' Haji Abdul Rahman Nasir, Secretary to the Terengganu Government and Chairman of the Terengganu State Museum Board at the time.</p>
        <h3>Phase V</h3>
        <p>Phase V was carried out in 1993 with the construction of the Maritime Museum II (Fishing Gallery and Marine Park).</p>
        <p>In terms of manpower, the State Museum started with the recruitment of three (3) staff members in 1979. The addition of staff continued to increase rapidly until the entry of a Curator in 1981 who was then appointed as the first State Museum Director.</p>
        <p>The Museum complex was completed in 1984. With the expertise available, the work of preparing the exhibition gallery was carried out, and finally the complex could be opened to visitors. The inauguration ceremony of this complex was inaugurated on 20 April 1996 by His Majesty Sultan Mahmud Al Mukhtafi Billah Shah, the 15th Sultan of Terengganu.</p>
        <p>Now in the era of the 21st century, the State Museum with its existing facilities and a staff of nearly 200 people continues to step bravely to achieve the objectives of its establishment while playing an important role as an agent of state and community development.</p>
        <h3>Terengganu State Museum Design Concept</h3>
        <p>The Terengganu State Museum Complex Design Concept was inspired by Yang Mulia Dato' Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah. Three main considerations have been made in realizing the design of the main building of the Terengganu State Museum Complex.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Related to the image or design of the building.</li>
            <li>Space layout planning.</li>
            <li>Building orientation facing the river.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To add more "traditional" features, an artificial lagoon has been built as a "fantasy pool" shade pool near the river bank. The existence of this shadow pool will be able to reduce the concept of building scale to a concept based on human scale.</p>
        <h3>Use of Space</h3>
        <p>The Main Museum building consists of 4 blocks namely Block A, B, C and D. The total floor area is 75,750 square meters, while the floor area of ​​the exhibition space is 27,272 square meters.</p>
        <p>Block A is the highest block and is also the main block. It consists of 5 floors. Part of the space in block A, which is on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors houses the permanent exhibition gallery, while the 1st floor is used for the curatorial space, library and prayer hall. The ground floor is reserved for the collection storeroom and photography lab. The main visitor entrance is located on the 2nd floor of this block.</p>
        <p>Block B is used entirely for exhibition space, which houses 3 permanent exhibition galleries, while Block C, which consists of 4 floors, is used for temporary exhibition space, a permanent exhibition gallery, administration room, meeting room, natural resources laboratory, conservation laboratory, conference room and craft workshop.</p>
        <p>Block D located at the very back provides space for the Theater Hall, which can accommodate 220 people at a time.</p>
        <p>There are 11 exhibition galleries in the main building. Among these galleries are the Textile Gallery, Craft, History and Pre-History, Royal, Islamic, Natural Resources and Economy, Temporary Exhibition, Petroleum, Menteri Besar, Fisheries and Marine Park Gallery and Navigation and Trade Gallery.</p>
        <p>In addition, in the Museum Complex area there are also 5 traditional houses, a medicinal garden that can be visited by visitors. For the convenience of visitors, parking, cafeteria, souvenir shop, waqf, benches and surau are also provided.</p>
