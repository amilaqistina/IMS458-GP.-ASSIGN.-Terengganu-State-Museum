            <h3>History of Establishment of Kemaman District Museum</h3>
            <p>The establishment of the Kemaman District Museum which focuses on distinguished individuals in the State of Terengganu was planned and initiated by the Kemaman District Museum Development Committee and was approved in the Terengganu State Museum Board Meeting.</p>
            
            <p>Since the State of Terengganu has many successful figures in various fields either at the national level or at the international level, the establishment of the Remembered Services Museum is considered necessary to commemorate the services and give due recognition to those concerned.</p>
            
            <p>The people who are highlighted in this museum are among the millions of Terengganu people who are very successful in their respective fields, whether in politics, administration, sports, culture, religion, literature or education.</p>
            
            <p>It is hoped that the museum that displays the heroic deeds, sacrifices, services and struggles of these glorious people will provide 1001 useful information especially to the new generation so that they can emulate, inspire and then emulate the success of these figures in their respective fields in making the name of the state and also the country.</p>

            <h3>Early History of the Building of Malayan Banking</h3>
            <p>The Kemaman District Museum building was built in the 1920s. The architecture of this one-story concrete building is a combination of English architecture and Islamic architecture resulting in a form of Moorish-style architecture. This building is located in the heart of the city center within an area of ​​0.2 acres at Lot 132, Jalan Sulaimani, Chukai, Kemaman. This building used to be the iron ore mine manager's office of The Nanyo Kogyo Koshi Company which carried out iron ore mining activities in Macang Setahun, Kemaman.</p>
            
            <p>This building later became the property of one of the commercial banks namely Malayan Banking Berhad and functioned as a bank. In 2008, this building was purchased by the Terengganu State Government from the Kemaman Municipal Council and handed over to the Terengganu State Museum on March 5, 2009 to be developed as a regional museum and at the same time as a new tourist destination to the southernmost district of the State of Terengganu, which is the Kemaman District.</p>
            
            <p>On 15 October 2009, the conservation work of this building was carried out by two companies appointed by the Kemaman District Public Works Department.</p>

            <h3>Objectives of the Establishment of the Kemaman District Museum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exhibiting all forms of records and documents related to the value of sacrifice, struggle and success of figures in the State of Terengganu in their respective fields.</li>
                <li>Recalling the services and devotion of local figures who have made a huge contribution to the progress and development of the State of Terengganu.</li>
                <li>Elevating the dignity of state figures to the national stage so that they can be used as icons for the masses, especially for the young generation of Nusa heirs.</li>
                <li>Making this museum one of the destinations and tourism products in Kemaman District in particular and Terengganu State in general.</li>
