        <h2>What is The Museum?</h2>
        <p>The word "Museum" used today is taken from the English word. However 'Museum' in English comes from the Greek word 'Mouseion' which means the holy house of 'MUSE' which is a god or a group of nine goddesses who are symbols of knowledge and art.</p>
        <p>'MUSE' in Greek also means 'Enjoy' or in English 'Amusement'.</p>
        <p>In classical Greek times 'museum' was also known as:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "A place sacred to the Muse specifically, the great institution for literature and scientific studies built and equipped by Ptolemy I at Alexandria, which was virtually a university of Hellenistic world"
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first museum is believed to have been established in Alexandria, Egypt in the 3rd century BC. Starting from that, many experts and scholars raced to throw their respective understandings regarding the definition of a museum.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "An institution for the preservation of those objects which best illustrate the phenomena of nature and the work of man, and utilization of these to increase knowledge and for the culture and enlightenment of the people"
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the meantime, there are some definitions that are temporary or still vague. For example by the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the Canadian Union of Museums (CMN) and the American Association of Museums (AAM). Most of the definitions relate to the functions of museums and their management as well as fields related to museology.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "The institution is permanent, not seeking profit, serving the community and its development, open to the public, acquiring, treating, connecting and exhibiting for the purposes of learning, education and entertainment, evidence of human remains and their environment"
        </blockquote>
        <p>In response to this definition, several activities and fields are linked together as support. Among them, museums are also defined as institutions involved with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conservation, exhibition and Archive Centre.</li>
            <li>Conservation and preservation of nature.</li>
            <li>Archaeology, Ethnology, Monuments and Historic Sites.</li>
            <li>Exhibition of living things such as Botanical Garden, Zoology, Aquarium and so on.</li>
            <li>Science Center and Planetarium.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the definition, it cannot be denied that museums play an important role in the field of education, culture and economic development for every country and society. In fact, the museum also forms and takes a major part in developing society and the country through its various roles (Multifunctional role).</p>
        <p>Accordingly, in 1989 the Museums Association of Great Britain (MAGB) defined museums in a form that is easier to understand. The museum institute is defined as:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "An institution which collects, documents, preserves, exhibits and interprets material evidence and associated information for public benefit"
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Malaysia, the museum was initially known as the "School of Pictures" because in addition to archaeological artifacts, historical photographs were also exhibited in abundance in the museum building.</p>
        <p>However, the passage of time and the increase in experience and knowledge of certain groups, especially those directly related to the management and activities of the museum, have succeeded in forming a new identity for the museum. This also changes the public's view of the institution.</p>
        <p>Although there are various forms of perception and different definitions of the museum institution, it is correct if the museum is described through the activities and capabilities shown by a museum. The success of a museum in dealing with all the problems that exist in trying to achieve the objectives of its establishment is completely dependent on the ability and sense of responsibility of its staff.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a museum is appropriately defined based on the ability and success shown through the activities carried out based on its function and objective line.</p>
